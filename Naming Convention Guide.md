# Naming Convention Guide

This document outlines the naming conventions for different types of files and applications within our development projects, including VBScript files, VAF, and non-VAF applications. Consistent naming enhances clarity, maintainability, and collaboration across projects.

## General Guidelines

1. **Clarity and Purpose:** Each part of the name should clearly reflect its role.
2. **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent pattern across all projects.
3. **Avoid Abbreviations:** Use full words for better readability.
4. **Scalability:** Design names to accommodate future applications or modules.
5. **Standardized Separators:** Use dashes (`-`) to separate parts of the name for readability.

## Naming Conventions

### VBScript Files

**Format:** `Company.ModuleOrFeature.ScriptPurpose`

- **Company:** The organization or team responsible for the script.
- **Module or Feature:** The specific area or functionality the script addresses.

**Example:** `TDW.MFD-Processing.Extract-File`

#### Breakdown:

- **Company:** TDW
- **Module or Feature:** MFD-Processing
- **Script Purpose:** Extract-File

### VAF Applications

**Format:** `Company.VAF-Module.Feature-Specifics`

- **Company:** The organization or team responsible for the application.
- **VAF Module:** The specific VAF module or area the application addresses.
- **Feature Specifics:** Detailed description of the application's feature.

**Example:** `TDW.VAF-Dashboard.Background-Task-Reporting`

#### Breakdown:

### Non-VAF Applications

**Format:** `Company.Module.Feature-Specifics`

- **Company:** The organization or team responsible for the application.

## Best Practices

1. **Document Naming Conventions:** Keep a comprehensive guide for team reference.
2. **Use Descriptive and Meaningful Names:** Ensure names clearly describe the function and purpose.
3. **Keep Names Concise:** Balance between being descriptive and maintaining brevity.
4. **Review and Update Regularly:** Periodically revisit naming conventions to ensure they continue to meet project needs.

By following these conventions, we ensure our development projects are well-organized, easy to navigate, and scalable for future growth.
